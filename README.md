Tree-based auto-completion is a sophisticated algorithmic approach
employed in text prediction systems to enhance user experience and 
productivity. This method harnesses the hierarchical structure of 
language data, organizing it into a tree-like structure for efficient 
searching and prediction. The algorithm begins by constructing a tree 
where each node represents a sequence of characters or words. As a user
inputs text, the algorithm traverses this tree, predicting the   most likely
next characters or words based on the context of the input.
